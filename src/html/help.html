            <h2 class="md-headline">Concept</h2>

            <p>Take control of your browser tabs! With this extension you are able to change some behaviors on any
                website. Define your rules and let the extension makes the job automatically.</p>

            <p>All of your data are stored on your computer, I don't have any access to it.</p>

            <md-divider></md-divider>

            <h2 class="md-headline">Features</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>You can <strong>rename</strong> a tab.</li>
                <li>You can change any tab <strong>(fav)icon</strong>.</li>
                <li>You can <strong>pin</strong> a website without effort.</li>
                <li>You can <strong>protect</strong> some websites from accidental closure with a confirm box.</li>

            <h2 class="md-headline">Tab Rules</h2>

            <p>You have to create a "tab rule". A tab rule has:</p>

            <h3>Name</h3>

            <p>This name is used for you, just to find your rule among others.</p>

            <h3>Detection</h3>

            <p>Choices are either "Starts with", "Contains", "Exact", "Ends with" or "RegExp". The extension must know
                how to apply your rule depending on the detection you need. You may need to catch a word inside the URL
                so you will select "Contains" or catch only PNG files so you will select "Ends with", etc. Most of the
                time, "Contains" does what you want, this is the default selected detection.</p>

            <h3>URL fragment</h3>

            <p>This is the key of your rule. It will determine if your rule will be applied or not. You want to catch
                GMail? You can set your rule with "Contains" detection and "mail.google.com" URL fragment. Another
                solution could be to set "Starts with" detection and "https://mail.google.com". Try any combination to
                achieve what you want.</p>

            <p>If you are familiar with regular expressions, select "RegExp" detection and enter the expression in the
                URL fragment input. Try to match GitHub with "github[.]com/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)".</p>

            <p><u><b>After defining the core of your rule you can select some actions listed below.</b></u></p>

            <h3>Title</h3>

            <p>This action will rewrite the website title.</p>

            <p>Define the new titile in the input. Sometimes, you want to inject variables inside the title. As the
                extension has access to the HTML document, almost everything can be injected in the title. Use the
                braces syntax, example: if you need to inject website title, add <code>{title}</code> as
                <code>title</code> is a valid CSS selector parsed with <code>document.querySelector()</code> (developers
                will understand). So you can inject <code>{h1}</code>, <code>{#id}</code>, <code>{.class}</code> etc.
                Obviously, if there is more than one <code>{h1}</code> in the document, the first one is selected.</p>

            <p>Another advanced usage can be used with the title, you can inject some parts of the URL with the dollar
                syntax. This feature is linked to the "URL matcher" action, see afterwards. Use <code>$0</code>,
                <code>$1</code>, etc. depending on your regular expression defined in "URL matcher".</p>

            <p>As you can scan the URL, you can also scan the title and inject some parts of it with the "at (@)"
                syntax. This feature is linked to the "Title matcher" action, see afterwards. Use <code>@0</code>,
                <code>@1</code>, etc. depending on your regular expression defined in "Title matcher".</p>

            <h3>Icon</h3>

            <p>This action will replace the website (fav)icon.</p>

            <p>You can select an icon provided by the extension.</p>

            <p>Otherwise, you can define an icon URL in the input like "https://www.google.com/favicon.ico".</p>

            <p>In case you want to define a local icon from your computer, you have 2 options:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>upload your icon somewhere like <a href="http://imgur.com/upload" target="_blank">imgur.com</a> and
                    paste the direct link</li>
                <li>go to <a href="http://duri.me/" target="_blank">duri.me</a> and drag & drop your icon, then click on
                    "Copy as DataURI" and paste it. This is your icon transformed in the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme" target="_blank">Data URI format</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Pinned</h3>

            <p>This action will pin the tab.</p>

            <h3>Protected</h3>

            <p>This action will ask you before closing the tab.</p>

            <p><i>Note: the confirm box will be triggered if you (or the website itself) refresh the tab, as the
                    extension can't differentiate closure and refresh.</i></p>

            <h3>Unique</h3>

            <p>This action will automatically close duplicate tabs. Besides the extension will not focus the original
                tab after closing the duplicate one.</p>

            <p>Scenario: create a rule based on GMail with unique action. Open GMail, open another GMail, the last one
                will be closed.</p>

            <h3>Muted</h3>

            <p>This action will prevent the tab from playing sounds.</p>

            <p>To work, this feature requires that you enable this flag: <i>chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting</i>
                then restart your browser.</p>

            <h3>Title matcher</h3>

            <p>An advanced usage, enter a regular expression to identify some title parts and use them inside the title
                itself, this is useful to reorder words or exclude some parts of the title, like
                <code>[a-z]*@gmail.com</code> and use <code>@0</code> in the title input to inject the variable.</p>

            <h3>URL matcher</h3>

            <p>An advanced usage, enter a regular expression to identify some URL parts and use them inside the title,
                like <code>q=([^&]+)</code> and use <code>$0</code> in the title input to inject the variable.</p>

            <md-divider></md-divider>

            <h2 class="md-headline">Additional notes</h2>

            <p>After creating or editing a rule, refresh the tab(s) to apply the changes.</p>

            <p>The order of your rules is important, if an URL triggers more than one rule, the first one will be
                applied. You can reorder your rules anyway.</p>

            <p>Some interesting tab rules are listed <a href="https://github.com/sylouuu/chrome-tab-modifier#examples"
                    target="_blank">here</a> for inspiration purposes.</p>
